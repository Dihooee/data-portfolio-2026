# Day 1 — SQL Practice Notes

## What I did
- Created a simple `sales` table (order_id, order_date, customer, amount)
- Inserted 8 sample rows
- Wrote multiple queries to explore, filter, sort, and aggregate the data

## Key SQL patterns learned
- `SELECT` chooses columns (`*` = all columns)
- `WHERE` filters rows by conditions
- `ORDER BY` sorts results
- `LIMIT` returns top N rows
- `GROUP BY` + `SUM()` aggregates totals by group
- `COUNT(*)` counts rows

## Quick findings from my sample data
- Top customer by total spending: **Cathy (254.0)**
- Sam placed **2** orders (35.5 + 22.0)
- Alan placed **2** orders (18.0 + 8.5)
