# Data Portfolio (Starting from Zero)

## Who I am
UCL Comparative Literature student transitioning into tech.

## What this repo proves
- I can answer business questions with SQL
- I can clean/analyse data with Python
- I can present insights clearly (reports + dashboard screenshots)

## Navigation
- [SQL](./sql)
- [Python](./python)
- [Report](./report)
- [Assets](./assets)

## Roadmap (first 2 weeks)
- [ ] Set up repo structure
- [ ] Write 10 SQL questions → convert to real queries
- [ ] Build a small Python analysis notebook
- [ ] Write a 1-page insight report

## Why this matters
Non-CS background, so I focus on tangible proof (projects + clear documentation).
